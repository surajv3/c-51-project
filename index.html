            Butterfly Wings Are Transparent.
            Butterflies Taste With Their Feet.
            Butterflies Live on an All-Liquid Diet.

            Frogs absorb water through their skin so they don't need to drink.
            Frogs can lay as many as 4,000 eggs in frogspawn.
            The eyes and nose of a frog are on top of its head so it can breathe and see when most of its body is under the water.
